mpv-reload-simple
=================

Lua script to automatically reload streams that get stuck in mpv media player.

Inspired by and very much simplified version of
https://github.com/4e6/mpv-reload

In particular no EOF and no playlist handling, just that of a simple stream URL.


Changelog:
---------

* Remove paused-for-cache monitoring.
Reloads are now exlusively done by demuxer cache monitoring, based on two
factors: how long the cache didn't receive any updates and how many seconds of
buffered media still remain. This is not only functionally sufficient but also
provides for an overall smoother reload experience.

* Add HTTP redirection on load.
Some web sites regularly change their media URL. We added code to optionally
scan a site for a new URL and redirect to there upon stream load, by means of
the according hook.
